## 🔬 Research Motivation

### The Robust Regression Challenge

**Standard Least Squares Problem**: Traditional OLS regression fails catastrophically under outlier contamination, with a **breakdown point of 0%** - even a single extreme outlier can arbitrarily skew results.

**Real-World Implications**:
- **Financial modeling**: Market data with flash crashes and anomalous trading
- **Sensor networks**: IoT data streams with faulty sensor readings  
- **Medical research**: Clinical measurements with recording errors
- **Time series analysis**: Economic indicators with structural breaks

### Why Theil-Sen Matters

The **Theil-Sen estimator** achieves a theoretical **breakdown point of 29.3%**, meaning it remains stable even when nearly one-third of data points are outliers. This makes it uniquely valuable for:

1. **High-contamination environments** where other robust methods fail
2. **Non-parametric trend estimation** without distributional assumptions
3. **Structural change detection** in time series and panel data
4. **Exploratory data analysis** for unknown data quality scenarios

## 🧮 Mathematical Framework

### Classical Theil-Sen Estimator

The Theil-Sen slope estimator is defined as:

```
β̂_TS = median{(y_j - y_i)/(x_j - x_i) : 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n}
```

Where the slope is the **median of all pairwise slopes** between data points.

**Intercept Estimation**:
```
α̂_TS = median{y_i - β̂_TS × x_i : i = 1,...,n}
```

### Algorithmic Variants Implemented

#### 1. **Classical Implementation**
- **Complexity**: O(n²) space and time
- **Precision**: Exact median of all (n choose 2) pairwise slopes
- **Use Case**: Small to medium datasets (n < 1000) requiring maximum precision

#### 2. **Subsampling Strategy**
- **Approach**: Compute multiple subsample medians, then take median-of-medians
- **Complexity**: O(k × m²) where k = number of subsamples, m = subsample size
- **Advantage**: Scalable to large datasets while maintaining robustness
- **Innovation**: Adaptive subsample sizing based on data characteristics

#### 3. **Bootstrap Variant**  
- **Method**: Bootstrap resampling with replacement for uncertainty quantification
- **Output**: Point estimates + confidence intervals
- **Applications**: Hypothesis testing and interval estimation
- **Statistical Validity**: Asymptotically consistent under mild regularity conditions

## 📊 Experimental Design

### Synthetic Data Generation

We systematically evaluate performance across three challenging data patterns:

#### **Pattern 1: Linear with Outliers**
```r
# Clean linear trend with strategic outlier contamination
y = β₀ + β₁x + ε, where ε ~ N(0, σ²)
# Outliers: 15% of points with |deviation| > 5σ
```

#### **Pattern 2: Step Change Data**  
```r
# Piecewise constant with abrupt level shift
y = {1000  for x ∈ [1, n/3]
     {5000  for x ∈ [n/3+1, n]
# Challenges median-based estimators with structural breaks
```

#### **Pattern 3: Pathological (Alternating Slopes)**
```r
# Adversarial pattern designed to confound robust estimators
y = {-0.5x + 50  for odd x
     {+0.5x + 50  for even x
# Tests breakdown point and bias resistance
```

### Performance Metrics

1. **Bias**: |β̂ - β_true| (parameter estimation accuracy)
2. **Variance**: Std(β̂) across Monte Carlo trials  
3. **Breakdown Point**: Minimum outlier fraction causing estimator failure
4. **Computational Efficiency**: Execution time scaling with dataset size
5. **Confidence Interval Coverage**: Bootstrap interval accuracy
